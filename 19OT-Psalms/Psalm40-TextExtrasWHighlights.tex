\textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{I waited \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{patiently} for the LORD; and he inclined unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}, and heard my cry.}
[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{He brought \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me} up also out of an horrible \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{pit}, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, \emph{and} established my goings.}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \emph{even} \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{praise} unto our God: many shall see \emph{it}, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Blessed \emph{is} that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{proud}, nor such as turn aside to lies.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Many, O LORD my God, \emph{are} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} wonderful works \emph{which} thou hast done, and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} thoughts \emph{which} \emph{are} to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: \emph{if} I would declare and speak \emph{of} \emph{them}, they are more than can be numbered.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book \emph{it} \emph{is} written of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me},}
[8] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{I delight to do \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} will, O my God: yea, \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} law \emph{is} within my heart.}
[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{I have \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{preached} righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.}
[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{I have not hid \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} righteousness within my heart; I have declared \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} faithfulness and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} salvation: I have not concealed \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} lovingkindness and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} truth from the great congregation.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Withhold not thou \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} tender mercies from \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}, O LORD: let \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} lovingkindness and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{thy} truth continually \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{preserve} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}.}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For innumerable evils have \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{compassed} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me} about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}.}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}: O LORD, make haste to help \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{me}.}
