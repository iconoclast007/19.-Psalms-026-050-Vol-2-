Consider Psalm 16:4,\footnote{\textbf{Psalm 16:4} - Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.} Isaiah 6:13,\footnote{\textbf{Isaiah 6:13} - But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.} and Revelation 6:11.\footnote{\textbf{Revelation 6:11} - And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.}\cite{Ruckman1992PsalmsV1}
