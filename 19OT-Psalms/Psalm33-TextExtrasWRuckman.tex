\begin{compactenum}
\item He is to rejoice in the Lord (which will find a spiritual counterpart in Phil. 4:4).
\item He is to praise the Lord on a musical instrument.

\item He is to play skillfully and loudly on his instrument.

Paul’s “third heaven” (2 Cor. 12:2) points to this truth. Naturally, all of the scholars (100 percent)— including all the Fundamentalists and Conservatives—miss all the references. (See comments under Ps. 18:16 and 22:3). The reference is to the “waters that be above the heavens” (Ps. 148:4), which no astronaut, astronomer, or physicist knows anything about. (See comments on “Leviathan” in the Bible Believer’s Commentary on Job). “The earth” and “the world” (vs. 8) occur on a lower level exactly as the heaven of Genesis 1:14 is on a lower level than the heaven of Genesis 1:8. All of the Hebrew scholars miss all the references. Kroll (Falwell’s school) finds one correct cross reference (Gen. 1:8) but, when he gets to that reference, he duplicates the 1909 Scofield note, which contradicts Psalm 148:4. He says the water “above the heavens” is “vapour,” i.e. the clouds. It certainly is not, for it is water above the Solar System. Dummelow says the passage is referring to a non-existent, mythological place which lays beneath the earth. Jamieson runs you to Exodus, chapter 15 for a local flooding of Pharaoh, but Taylor just comes right out and lies flatly: he says the reference is to the “oceans.” That is what they taught in Christopher Columbus’ day, and that is why they were afraid of a “DRAGON” (Job 41:1-–13) getting them at the end of the “ocean.” Wrong ocean. The “dragon that is in the sea” (Isa. 27:1–3) is not in the Atlantic or Pacific. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }

They were always of this frame of mind: the Caesars, the popes, Constantine, the popes, Charlemagne, the popes, Napoleon, the popes, Hitler, the popes, etc. In contrast to these “counsels” and “devices,” are the Lord’s “counsels” and “thoughts” (vs. 11). He will have HIS way (Isa. 58:2), and “the people” will not have their way. His people will land “on top of the pile” (Rom. 11:15, 26), and the heathen will wind up on the bottom of it (Isa. 2:11). “Whose God is the Lord,” not dialectical materialism, Marxism, Capitalism, Catholicism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Allah, education, science, or a wineheaded bachelor in Rome.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }

All men are made “alike” when it comes to the functions of imaginations, feelings, impulses, motives, and ambitions; though they are depraved (and God is not responsible for this), they are made “alike” in the sense that every man (“all...alike”) is under God, with no exceptions. The ways that God “fashioned” or framed the heart are as follows:
\begin{compactenum}
\item So that it can be tried (Jeremiah 17:10).
\item So that it can love Him (Deuteronomy 6:5).
\item So that it can love something else (1 Peter 1:22).
\item So that it can rejoice (Psalm 33:21).
\item So that it can have trouble (John 14:27).
\item So that it can be hardened (John 12:40).
\item So that it can faint (Deuteronomy 20:8).
\item So that it can be ``perfect'' (1 Kings 8:61).
\item So that it can study (Proverbs 15:28).
\item So that it can ``speak'' (Matthew 12:34).
\item So that it can lust (Matthew 5:28).
\end{compactenum}
In addition to this, men’s hearts are fashioned ``alike'' in the sense that they all desire immortality and all need a ``God'' to worship; furthermore, they seek three basic animal goals: self-preservation, self-propagation, and self-gratification.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }

\begin{compactenum}
\item If the enemy’s horse is faster, you lose.
\item If the other rider has a bow (or guns) and you don’t, you lose.
\item If your horse stumbles or is crippled, you are done for.
\item If your horse tires too quickly, you are captured.
\item If you cannot control your horse you might as well walk. 
\end{compactenum}
God is the missing factor.
In the old days they trusted in horses (vs. 17) and thought that when their cavalry was gone, they were gone (2 Kings 7:13). Ahaziah and Joash couldn’t get away on their horses fast enough, and Pharaoh’s horse (Ex. 15:19) didn’t do him much good either. “An horse is a vain thing for safety.” If you flee quickly, those that pursue you will be quicker (Isa. 30:16). Zedekiah’s horse got him nowhere (2 Kings 25:5). In the modern vernacular, a tank is a “vain thing” for safety, so is an airplane. The deliverance (vs. 19) will have to come from God, not alliances with Russia, China, the PLO, the pope, or the UN. No king is saved by “the multitude of an host,” and that is why David did wrong when he “numbered the people” (2 Sam. 18:1). He was glorying in his military power. He was counting on his Polaris missiles and nuclear warheads. “A mighty man,” for example, Sampson, “is not delivered by much strength.” All the “mighty men of valor” in Sennacherib’s army (over one hundred eighty thousand) were “sacked” in one night (2 Chron. 32:21). \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} }
